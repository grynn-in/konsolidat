   row (konsolidat#124), so a scoped close re-derived it in full anyway. As
   delete+insert it only replaced the keys the SELECT produced, and a key that

{# Layer 6: Acquisition & disposal adjustments (PRD-11/12).
   #175 re-review F3: the pnl_proration rows are one per consolidated row,
   and gold_consolidated_trial_balance has a row per intercompany partner,
   so they are summed to the account grain here, like layer 1. Otherwise
   gold_consolidated_ytd ran a separate running total per row.
   konsolidat#198: the goodwill and fair-value lines come from the balanced
   acquisition journal (gold_business_combination_journal, posted from the
   submitted Business Combination), not from gold_acquisition_adjustments,
   which keeps only the partial-period P&L adjustment (#171 2c: it follows
   the group's declared partial_period_treatment, and its balancing line sits
   on the retained-earnings account). Row J5: the monthly goodwill
   amortisation journal (gold_goodwill_amortisation_journal, empty unless the
   group's goodwill_treatment is 'Amortise') joins the layer. Row J6: the
   disposal journal (gold_business_disposal_journal, posted from the
   submitted Business Disposal: derecognition, goodwill, FVA, CTA recycling,
   NCI, proceeds, gain or loss) replaces gold_disposal_adjustments' one-sided
   'DISPOSAL' rows; that model is now empty.
   Row J11 (PR #203 review 7): the journals post several lines to one account
   in one period when the roles differ (the acquisition journal's
   opening_balance and equity_eliminated lines on the same equity account,
   the disposal journal's derecognised and proceeds lines on the same cash
   account), so each journal branch is SUMmed to the account grain
   (group, entity, year, period, account, adjustment_type, journal_id) like
   the proration branch: passed through line by line, gold_consolidated_ytd's
   ROWS window ran a separate running total per line (-687.5, then 0, instead
   of 0). account_role is a line attribute, not part of the grain, and stays
   in the journal models; assert_journal_grain_unique proves the grain.
   Row J13 (PR #203 second review 2): journal_id left the grain too. The YTD
   window partitions by (group, entity, year, account, adjustment_type,
   dimensions) and NOT by journal_id, so two journals of one entity on one
   account in one period (a second deal; an amortisation instalment is a
   different adjustment_type) were two rows under one running total again.
   Each branch now groups without journal_id and emits any(journal_id);
   assert_journal_grain_unique keys on the window's partition columns. #}
